Candidate Elimination
General Hypothesis
(?,?,?,?,?)

Specific Hypothesis
(0,0,0,0,0)

Initial Declarations:
(1)Write Specific Hyp(S0) as all nulls, and Generic hyp(G0) as all ??
(2)If 1st row op is +ve or -ve
   (a) If +ve, then S1=1st row values. G1=G0.
   (b) If -ve, then S1=S0.
	G1.. we will have determine invididual hypothesis for each element
	and write the opposite value of the 1st row elements each and fill rest of the values with ?
	Ex: (rainy,?,?,?,?,?),(?,cold,?,?,?,?),....
(3)If 2nd is +ve, after the 1st row is +ve,
