Candidate Elimintation:

1. Write specific hyp(S0) as 0 and general hyp(G0) as ? for the number of the features(columns), excluding OP column
2. Check from the 1st row/ Check if the result is +ve or -ve
3. If 1st row is -ve, go to Step 5.
If 1st row is +ve, then set G1=G0 and S1=1st row values. 
4. If 2nd row is +ve: then compare S1 with 2nd row values. If any element not matching, then add ? to that element in S2. If matching, then S2=S1.
For G2, G2=G1 since all ? will match with the individual elements.
If 2nd row is -ve: then for S2, even if one of the elements doesn't match, then set S2=S1. For G2, if all the elements match, then check follow step 5 instructions. After G2 is created, check if G2 is applicable for previous row elements as well. If any hyp is not matching, then remove that hyp set.
5. If 1st row is -ve, then set S1=S0. For G1, create individual hyp for each ? of G0 by substituting ? with the corresponding position's 1st row element. The num of hyp sets for this will be equal to num of row attributes.

6. Lastly, compare the final S and final G and check. If dissimilar, check if other hypotesis can be created.
